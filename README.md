# 💫 About Me:
Full stack software engineer - focused on web development.
Developed programs to support my work in Social Prescribing, including a tool that tailors suggestions to support patients on a waiting list for an appointment: signposting to local services for Mental Health, Housing, Benefits and Social Groups. 

I am now freelancing in web development! For more info see my Website: https://joemccarthy.netlify.app/
I am currently building an exercise library specifically for older adults at risk of falls.
